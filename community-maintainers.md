# Community maintainers

The Ember Learning Core Team manages so many resources that if we want to scale and improve the quality of our sites, we need the help of more people than just core team members!

A Community Maintainer is a volunteer who plays a key role in the Ember learning experience by helping open issues, respond to contributors, review PRs, and more.
In most cases, they are people who have already led specific projects themselves or are long-term collaborators on an initiative.
Unlike being on the core team, the role does not require the intensive participation level of a core team member (attending weekly meetings consistently, face-to-face meetings, emergency website maintenance expectations, RFC reviewing, etc).

The main benefits include:
- The opportunity to get more experience as an open source creator, maintainer, and leader 
- The ability to more actively drive forward a project they care about
- If/when there is a section on the website for including members of working groups, Community Maintainers will be shown there too

We are so thankful for everyone who helps support open source projects like Ember!

## Permissions

On a case-by-case basis, community members may be granted either a:

- Triage role that allows them to label issues, open and close PRs/Issues, and more
- Maintain role that allows for merging PRs

Read more about these roles [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization).

## Responsibilities

Community Maintainers are especially welcomed to our weekly team meetings, but not expected to attend every week. It is ok for participation to be cyclical. Responsibilities include:

- Respond to contributions in a way that is kind and helpful. Contributors view maintainers as the face of Ember, regardless of your role or involvement.
- Follow the Ember Code of Conduct
- Communicate with the core team point person about any big changes
- Ask the core team for clarification whenever in doubt
- Let us know if/when you won't have time to help and assist with a responsibilities hand-off
- Respond to questions from the core team
- Watch out for any security issues
- Know when to bring a question to the team for consensus
- Uphold code quality for the project (degree varies by project)
- Give and accept constructive feedback

## Process

- The Learning Team may invite community members to help maintain a specific app.
Adding someone new is discussed internally and requires consensus of the Learning Core Team members.
- The Community Maintainer is paired with a member of the core team (the buddy system)
- If the website shows the working groups/strike teams, the contributor would be added to that list if they want to be.
- They meet to go over responsibilities and answer any questions, and then pair a few PR reviews
- Once a month, the core team member and Community Maintainer chat about any developments in the project. If time zones allow, this is part of a Learning Team meeting.
- Maintainers who are inactive for more than 6 weeks may have permissions removed and may be removed from the working group listing on the public website. This serves to safeguard the security of our sites and keep development aligned with team goals (i.e. you have to be somewhat in the loop in order to make good judgement calls and represent the work being done).
- Repeated communication missteps with the community or core team may result in removal.
