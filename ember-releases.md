# Ember Releases

When a new version of Ember is released,
the learning team has to make sure some parts of our infrastructure are adequately updated to account for it.
**Please update the following in the listed order**:

## Prerequsites 

- install `tool-new-release` - this automates most of the things 

NOTE: The steps below are manual deploy steps. We have a CLI tool called
[`tool-new-release`](https://github.com/ember-learn/tool-new-release)
that automates these steps.

- install 1Password and make sure you have access to the `something` vault
- install `1password-cli` installed

## Release blog post

üíÅ manual process

**NOTE** ember-source, ember-data, and ember-cli must already be released.

1. Generate a new blog post for the release with `ember generate release-blog MAJOR.MINOR` where
MAJOR.MINOR is the version number, i.e `4.5`. There is a `--authors` option available which
defaults to the Ember Learning Team.
3. Open a PR with the template at [https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pulls](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pulls)
4. Tag core teams to fill in details

## Deprecations

1. Clone [deprecation-app](https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app).
2. To see deprecations in `ember-source`, you can visit [https://deprecations.emberjs.com/v3.x/](https://deprecations.emberjs.com/v3.x/).
3. Check if there are deprecations listed under "Upcoming Features" that are a part of the new release (e.g. `v3.25`).
4. Find the relevant Markdown file in `/content/ember/v3` folder.
5. Update the frontmatter `since: "Upcoming Features"` to `since: "v3.25"`.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for deprecations in `ember-data`. ([https://deprecations.emberjs.com/ember-data/v3.x](https://deprecations.emberjs.com/ember-data/v3.x))
7. Open a pull request.

## Guides

ü§ñ automated process (but would currently recommend the manual fallback)

Run the following command with `tool-new-release`

```
tool-new-release guides
```

Note: this just runs the `release:guides:minor` shell script from the guides-source repo and doesn't support major versions

    <summary>Fallback üíÅ Manual process</summary>

    Instructions are found in [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md#deploying-a-new-version).

</details>

## API documentation

ü§ñ automated process

Run the following command with `tool-new-release`

```
tool-new-release api-docs
```

Note: when this succeeds with no errors it still takes a while for the new version to show up in https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release

Note: if it's taking a very long time to show up then you probably need to perge the cache in Fastly. Log into https://fastly.com and click `Purge` and then `Purge all` for `api.emberjs.com`

    <summary>Fallback üíÅ manual process</summary>

    Instructions are found in the [README of ember-jsonapi-docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-jsonapi-docs#overriding-a-specific-version-of-yuidoc-file-with-a-local-copy-for-core-contributors).

</details>

## Guides search

ü§ñ automated process (but would currently recommend the manual fallback)

Run the following command with `tool-new-release`

```
tool-new-release guides-search
```

Note: this just runs the `release:search` shell script from the guides-source repo

<details>
    <summary>Fallback üíÅ manual process</summary>

    Instructions are found in [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md#updating-the-guides-search).

## 4. Release pages

The next release date is not affected by "delays", and should always be calculated as original date + 6 weeks.

1. Clone [ember-website](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website)
2. Edit the following files:
    1. `data/project/ember/lts.md`
    2. `data/project/ember/release.md`
    3. `data/project/ember/beta.md`
    4. `data/project/emberData/release.md`
    5. `data/project/emberData/beta.md`


## 6. Upgrade Guide

1. Clone [upgrade-guide](https://github.com/ember-learn/upgrade-guide) and run `npm install`. (You can run `ember serve` and visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see your changes take effect.)
2. Run `ember generate upgrade-notes <VERSION>` (e.g. `ember g upgrade-notes 3.25`) to create 3 Markdown files.
3. Edit the files by recording features and deprecations. You can find short descriptions for features and deprecations in the release blog post. (See [step 3](#3-release-blog-post))
4. Edit the `app/utils/ember-versions.js` file. Append the release version to the end of the array.
5. Run `yarn lint` and `yarn test`. (You will likely need to update 1 test assertion. It checks how many features and deprecations can be seen since Ember 3.15 release.)
6. Open a pull request, then merge it.

## 7. Glitch Ember starter

Since generating a new application using ember-cli made Glitch run out of memory,
the application is cloned from [ember-new-output](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-new-output).

1. Log in to [https://glitch.com/](https://glitch.com/)
1. Go to [https://glitch.com/edit/console.html?emberjs](https://glitch.com/edit/console.html?emberjs)
1. Update the local repository with `git fetch`
1. Check out the release version with `git reset --hard <VERSION>`. Replace `<VERSION>` with the correct tag, e.g. `v.3.25.0`
1. Add the following snippet for the Glitch button in `app/index.html`:
```
<!-- include the Glitch button to show what the webpage is about and
  to make it easier for folks to view source and remix -->
<div class="glitchButton" style="position:fixed;top:20px;right:20px;"></div>
<script src="https://button.glitch.me/button.js"></script>
```
5. Edit `package.json` to explicitly include port 4200: `"start": "ember serve -p 4200"`.

## 8. Ember Wikipedia

1. Go to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js).
2. Click the `Edit source` tab (you will likely need to login).
3. Update the `latest release version`, `latest release date`, `latest preview version` & `latest preview date` in the Infobox if they need updating.
4. Be sure to update the accessdate for the citation url of the releases page referenced on the `latest release date` line.

## 9. Release bot

1. Go to the core meta channel in Discord.
2. Mark current release as done with `!release done blog`.
3. Schedule next release with the `!release next M.mm YYYY-MM-DD` command. E.g. `!release next 3.26 2021-03-22`.
