# Initiatives

Generally an initiative is a long-running project that we plan to do as a team. Initiatives are discussed at team face-to-face meetings and we decide together what is most important for us to be working on and we assign those projects to be the current year's active initiatives.

Note: much like the academic year, the Learning Team Initiative year does not run from January-January but instead it runs from EmberConf to EmberConf. This means that we intend to complete any active Initiatives **before** the next EmberConf and we should plan accordingly.

## Initiative Tracking

Initiative tracking should be done using a public GitHub org-level project named "Learning Team 20xx Initiatives". Every year a new board will be created.

To add an initiative to the GitHub project you need to add a card and paste a link to another GitHub project into that card and hit save. The only thing that should be on this board is linked projects. Most of these other projects will also be ember-learn org-level projects on GitHub because most Initiatives span multiple repos.

## Tips for Initiatives

- Initiatives should be projects that have the possibility of being considered finished. They should not be long-lived projects such as "Bug Triaging". While this is an important part of our job that is not the point of this board ðŸ˜„
