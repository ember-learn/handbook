# Public Meeting Media

## Meeting Notes

Proposal - We will create a public Notion Workspace that is for Learning Team meeting notes, possible subteam meeting notes, and draft proposals. We will continue to upload these notes to the GitHub notes repo after each meeting.

### Q&A

**Why not just write notes directly in GitHub only?**

Using notion allows us to interact easily asynchronously, such as adding agenda items.

**Why not just write notes in Notion only?**

Note-taking apps come and go. It's important that the source of truth is something we always have the source for, and stable links.

**Where do we share these Notion links?**

We share them in dev-ember-learning whenever we have meetings. After a meeting is over, we share links to GitHub with people, not the notion docs. The thinking is that if someone misses a meeting, they should be able to easily catch up.

**Why have a public notion org at all?** 

If notes docs are assumed to be public, it is much easier and quicker to export them to GitHub - their final home and source of truth.

**Why not continue as-is?**

If we move to a once-a-month meeting for everyone, and sub project meetings on other weeks, we will ideally be involving even more community contributors, and we'll want to empower them to see other teams and contributors' work.

**What happens as notes URLs change?**

They will break over time, since we are not in direct control over these URLs. We accept the tradeoff of easy short term access for immediate community interactions over having long-term reference within Notion. Our long term reference must remain GitHub.

## Ideas for other tools/media forms

What are some other ways we can publicly share resources and direction for community members?
