# Public Meeting Media

## Meeting Notes

For Learning Team-related meetings that are open to the public, we will take our notes and create agendas directly in GitHub.
This allows our many collaborators to have immediate access to notes if they missed a meeting or like to skim the notes to stay up-to-date.
It also allows anyone to propose a discussion topic.
We take notes this way in order to include more open source contributors around the world, with varying work-life responsibilities and levels of participation.

### Process

- Prior to a meeting, a team member creates a PR in the [core-notes](https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes) repository.
Others may add GitHub Suggestions or comments in order to add to the agenda.
- The meeting facilitator merges those suggestions, and then takes notes.
- If anyone needs to share a link or resource during the meeting, they can add a comment or suggestion.
- At the end of the meeting, the facilitator commits and merges the notes themselves (optionally seeking a review first if they prefer). If any notes corrections/clarifications are needed, they can be done by core team or community members as additional PRs.
- The facilitator then creates next week's PR.
