# Public Meeting Media

## Meeting Notes

Proposal - For Learning Team-related meetings that are open to the public, we will take our notes and create agendas directly in GitHub.
This allows our many collaborators to have immediate access to notes if they missed a meeting or like to skim the notes to stay up-to-date.
It also allows anyone to propose a discussion topic.

### Process

Prior to a meeting, a team member creates a PR in the [core-notes](https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes) repository.
Others may add GitHub Suggestions in order to add to the agenda.
The meeting facilitator merges those suggestions, and then takes notes.
If anyone needs to share a link or resource during the meeting, they can add a comment or suggestion.
At the end of the meeting, the facilitator commits and merges the notes.
They then create next week's PR.

### Q&A


**Why not just write notes in Notion?**

Note-taking apps come and go. It's important that the source of truth is something we always have the source for, and stable links.


**Why not continue as-is?**

If we move to a once-a-month meeting for everyone, and sub project meetings on other weeks, we will ideally be involving even more community contributors, and we'll want to empower them to see other teams and contributors' work.
