# How We Work

This document outlines how the Learning Core Team self-organizes and provides learning leadership to the community. 

## Meetings

### Cadence

Since the Ember Learning Team has so many different areas of responsibility, we don't meet every week as a whole group. 

The day and time of the meeting will stay the same- but folks will break out into their areas of responsibility (AOR). Once a month, all AORs will meet for an all-hands meeting so that we all stay updated on all facets of the learning team.

Instead of a rotating facilitator, we will move back to a single facilitator with other core team members facilitating as a backup. 

### Attendance

Meetings are open to all members of the Ember Community unless otherwise specified. 

## Areas of Responsibility

We have four areas of responsibility in the Learning Core Team:
- infrastructure & tooling
- guides/api docs/tutorials
- website & outreach
- ember times
