# How We Work

This document outlines how the Learning Core Team self-organizes and provides learning leadership to the community. 

## Meetings

### Cadence

Since the Ember Learning Team has so many different areas of responsibility, we don't meet every week as a whole group. 

The day and time of the meeting will stay the same- but folks will break out into their areas of responsibility (AOR). This will facilitate new growth in the team by giving everyone the freedom to focus on their area of expertise. Once a month, all AORs will meet for an all-hands meeting so that we all stay updated on all facets of the learning team. 

Instead of a rotating facilitator, we will move back to a single facilitator with other core team members facilitating as a backup. 

### Attendance

All Learning Core Team members should make every attempt to attend their weekly AOR meeting and monthly all-hands meeting. Lack of attendance is one of the indicators that a team member should consider becoming an emeritus. 

Meetings are open to all members of the Ember Community unless otherwise specified. 

## Areas of Responsibility

We have identified four areas of responsibility in the Learning Core Team:
- infrastructure & tooling (including Ember Inspector)
- guides/api docs/tutorials
- website & outreach
- ember times

## Other

More information will be added to this document as it becomes clear how we can move forward with this idea.
