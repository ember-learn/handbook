In order to mentor and develop leadership skills within the Ember Learning Core Team, it benefits us to have a plan for ensuring we pay attention to the growth within our team. 


## Weekly meeting leadership

Currently, Todd has been facilitating meetings, with Mel as the backup. One way to share leadership in the learning team is to have rotating meeting leadership responsibilities.

### Responsibilities would include: 

- set up the agenda on Dropbox (same as we have been)
- post the link in the core-learning channel description
- act as the meeting facilitator (leading the discussion, ensuring that we stay on track with the agenda & conversation)
- extract the public notes and submit them to the GitHub repository for core team notes
- synthesize the to-do items into issues in the relevant GitHub repository for tracking


### Schedule
It would be beneficial to have a different meeting facilitator every two weeks. At the end of each core team meeting, the meeting facilitator can identify who the next meeting facilitator will be (either themselves for the second week, or ask for a volunteer). We should be roughly striving for equal rotation of willing participants.
