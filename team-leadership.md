In order to mentor and develop leadership skills within the Ember Learning Core Team, it benefits us to have a plan for ensuring we pay attention to the growth within our team.


## Weekly meeting leadership

We want to share leadership in the learning team is by having rotating meeting leadership responsibilities.

### Responsibilities

These leadership responsibilities include:

- Act as the meeting facilitator. You are expected to lead discussions according to the agenda, ensuring conversations are kept on topic and within agreed timeboxes.
- Once the meeting ends, you are responsible for:
  - Submit the meeting notes to [core-notes](https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes).
  - Synthetizing action items into issues and file them in the relevant GitHub repository or project.
  - Create the agenda for the following meeting.
  - Create an event on Discord for the following meeting. Make sure to include a link to the relevant agenda.

### Schedule

Ideally we have a different facilitator every meeting, decided at the start.
