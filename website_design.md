# Website- Design

## Styling and shared components

- Styling and shared components are managed through the [ember-styleguide](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide).
- Any proposed style must follow the branding guidelines (available on emberjs.com).
- Upstream changes are preferred to overrides.
- We will use themes to give the flexibility to implement (and develop) new themes.
- All of the code should be kept as simple as possible, to make it easy to contribute. Complexity on these sorts of sites will end up being a wall between contributors and code; community members shouldnâ€™t have to learn new tools just to contribute.
