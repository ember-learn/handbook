# SEO

We will employ standard SEO techniques (as standard as we can, since they seem to change over time)

- We will use standard “semantic web” and Accessibility - these also support SEO. (Use of <h1> tags for example)
- As most SEO things are rule of thumb we need to be constantly tracking our ranking and running “experiments” to improve our rankings for specific keywords
  [ ] create to-do list for how to track our ranking, to include method for sending regular reports to a place where they can be reviewed by the learning team
  [ ] plan running experiments to improve rankings for specific keywords
- [ ] decide: what specific keywords we want to track
- [ ] decide: what tool we are using to track ranking
- sub-domains are treated “mostly the same” as sub folders for SEO purposes
[ ] track and improve LH scores for all Ember sites: Google has mentioned that they take Lighthouse scores into account, so while this is relevant to every section in this document it should be considered particularly important to track and improve Lighthouse scores for all Ember sites 
[ ] decide: what kind of metrics do we want to gather, and how often?
